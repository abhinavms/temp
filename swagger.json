In this case, a new request with 'offset' parameter set to the last returned item count is sent.</li><li><b>Operation Run Time</b>: The maximum run time for a single operation is 30 seconds. When the 30-second time limit is reached, the operation returns fewer activities than requested and the response contains the 'hasMore' flag set to 'true'. This flag indicates that there are more activities to be returned. In this case, a new request with 'offset' parameter set to the last returned item count is sent. If the time limit has exceeded before any activities are included in the response (for example, due to slow database response), an error is returned.</li><li><b>Custom Properties Quantity</b>: The maximum number of custom properties used in the request and/or returned in the response is 50. If more than 50 properties are included in the request, an error message is returned. The 50-property restriction includes both the custom properties used in the 'fields' parameter and in the 'q' parameter.</li> <p>Note: the function in some cases may not found existing activities if they has been recently created or bring some activity fields with not actual values if they were recently updated. The following conditions need to be met in order for the function to return the actual data without the latency effect:<ul><li>The request doesn't require filtering by fields except the field status. It means if there is a \"q=...\" parameter, the query may not return recently created activities. There is one exception to this rule: you can use \"q=...\" parameter with a single expression status=='<status>' (e.g. status=='pending') exactly in this form. Such expression will allow to get matching activities including recent ones.</li></ul></p><p>Examples.<ul><li>The following request will return data without latency effect :</li></ul></p><p>GET https://&lt;environment_name&gt;.fs.ocs.oraclecloud.com/rest/ofscCore/v1/activities/?resources=tech6121000001&dateFrom=2019-08-14&dateTo=2019-08-14&q=status=='pending'&fields=activityId,resourceId,date,status'</p><p>This request contains query parameter in a form status=='some_status'<ul><li>The following request may miss some recently created activities (latency effect) :</li></ul></p><p>GET https://&lt;environment_name&gt;.fs.ocs.oraclecloud.com/rest/ofscCore/v1/activities/?resources=tech6121000001&dateFrom=2019-08-14&dateTo=2019-08-14&q=status != 'cancelled' and activityType in ['IN','TC','BR']&fields=activityId,resourceId,date,status'</p><p>This request contains query parameter in other form then status=='some_status' : it uses != comparison and another field (activityType)</p>",

Segmentable master activities should not be used with the operation as their statuses have a different flow and the result of the operation can be different from that of the other activities.</p>",

Never use this ability to access the events by their time, as this ability requires significant resources and may slow down other system functions if used extensivly.</p><p>Note that obtaining events from a subscription which happened before the subscription was created is not supported.

If 'Detect activity travel keys automatically' is checked in Statistics configuration, then it is recommended to pass country_code, city and postalCode.</li></ul></ul><p><b>Segmentable activities:</b><p>For requests related to segmentable activities the \"date\" parameter is mandatory. The function looks for resources that could begin the first segment on the specified date.</p> <p>The function will try to estimate the date of activity completion for each matching resource, considering the duration of the activity and available working hours in each date. Note that the system will only scan a limited amount of days into the future (not further than 2500 days from activity start) and also stops calculations if a resource has a long period of non working days consequently. If the complete date was not successfully estimated, the parameter \"estimatedCompleteDate\" will not be present in the response for that resource.</p></p><p><b>This operation is subject to the following conditions:</b></p>\nNumber of Requests:\nThe maximum number of requests that can be processed in parallel is 20.
